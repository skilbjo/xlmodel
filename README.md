##VBA Formatting Macros

These are the same macros I worked with while at Ernst & Young. When I left that company I felt lost without my formatting macros and quickly learned how to create my own.


###Installation

1. Enable the Developer ribbon in Excel
	
	-in the File tab, click options, and then click Cuztomize Ribbon
	
	-under Customize Ribbon, check the Developer box
	
2. In the Developer ribbon, create a new module in your Personal Macro Workbook (also known as the hidden Personal.xlxb).

3. Paste the .vbs text in and assing your shortcuts as you wish!

Enjoy!
